This contains cleaned and prepared data from kaggle dataset containing features of various cars and their safety using a Pandas dataframe. Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib were used to visualize analyze data about features in car safety for Scikit-Learn random forest model. The model was improved to 94.6% accuracy using 100 decision trees with k-nearest neighbors machine learning classification model.
